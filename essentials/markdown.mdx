## Advanced vs. Mini

Our Mini and Advanced systems are designed to meet different customer needs when it comes to PHI redaction.

The Mini system harnesses a fine-tuned transformer model to quickly and accurately reduce PHI. With benchmark results showing it processes a 6-minute mono file in about 83.58 seconds, Mini is ideal for high-volume or time-sensitive scenarios. Its streamlined architecture ensures that redaction is performed rapidly without compromising on quality, making it an excellent choice for environments where speed is crucial.

In contrast, the Advanced system leverages a private large language model (LLM) equipped with sophisticated reasoning capabilities. Although it takes around 185.39 seconds to process the same 6-minute file, the Advanced system excels in handling complex redaction tasks. Its integrated reasoning allows for a deeper contextual analysis, ensuring that even subtle or ambiguous PHI elements are accurately identified and redacted. This level of precision is particularly beneficial for applications where data security and comprehensive compliance are paramount.

### Using Mini model

```python
  BASE_URL = "https://voiceharbor.ai"
  usage_token = "USAGE_TOKEN"
  # Create a new job on the server via the class method.
  job_id = VoiceHarborClient.create_job(BASE_URL, usage_token)
  
  client = VoiceHarborClient(
      base_url=BASE_URL,
      job_id=job_id,
      token=usage_token,
      inputs_dir="./inputs/tests"
  )
  
  # Submit input files and the job file.and 
  job_params = {"files": [], "model":"mini"} 
  job_params = client.submit_files(job_params)
  job_file = client.submit_job(job_params)
  logger.info(f"Job file created: {job_file}")
```
