## Speech to Text

Our advanced ASR technology is built on the robust foundation of OpenAI's Whisper, known for its exceptional performance in multilingual speech recognition. However, we've significantly enhanced its capabilities with in-house innovations, including the implementation of phonetic time-stamps. These detailed markers provide an extra layer of precision by capturing the timing of specific phonetic elements within the audio, enabling more granular analysis and synchronization.

Our ASR component support's for up to 99 languages and robust code-switching capabilities, it effortlessly transcribes audio that blends multiple languages. Its built-in automatic language detection ensures that users do not have to manually specify the language, streamlining the workflow, while precise time-stamps allow for easy navigation and review of audio content.

 ## Audio transcription without PHI reduction 

<Tip>

Speech to text is by **default** applied for the task **protect**. To have the transcription without any reduction use the **task** parameter.
